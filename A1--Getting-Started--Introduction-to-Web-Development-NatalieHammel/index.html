    <p> Hello! Welcome to Natalie Hammel's first website. Please be patient as I
    test a variety of eye-straining colors and obnoxious fonts - just kidding!
    Or am I? That is up to you to decide. </p>

    <p> Because this website is informally about me, I should introduce myself:</p>

<ul>
  <li> I was born in Prague, Czech Republic </li>
  <li> I have 6 chickens, one of which is blind in one eye</li>
  <li> My athletic ability falters after 3 miles of running </li>
</ul>

<p> Hm, I believe that is all the basics about me!
    If you're curious for more, feel free to look at my LinkedIn:</p>
